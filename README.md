🎬 Netflix Clone 🎨
Welcome to my Netflix Clone, built entirely using HTML5 and CSS3! 🚀
In this project, I set out to recreate the sleek, iconic Netflix UI, and along the way, I picked up some great skills:

Semantic HTML: Structuring the page with meaning, making it accessible and SEO-friendly. 🏗️
CSS Flexbox & Grid: Mastered responsive layout techniques to ensure the design looks pixel-perfect across devices. 📱💻
Responsive Design: Implemented a mobile-first approach to make sure the site adapts seamlessly, whether on a phone or a big screen. 🔄
Media Queries: Learned how to tweak styles for different screen sizes using media queries, ensuring a smooth experience for all users. 🔧
UI/UX Focus: I aimed for a clean, intuitive, and visually engaging user experience, paying close attention to design details. ✨
Feel free to dive into the code, experiment, and make it your own! 🌟
